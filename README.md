#Slother#
[Play it here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Eldeeff/slother/fca78d76/index.html).

A working version of Slother playable in the browser, implemented with JavaScript. Though you won't get very far...

All basic scoring methods are present, and the player recieves an additional life when 10,000 points are scored with fewer than 4 sloths left. Slother moves on canvas using UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys. If slother collides with a vehicle or water, he loses a life. 

A leveling system is included that speeds up the cars after 5 sloths have been crawled home.
